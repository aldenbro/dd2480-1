# Assignment 1 - Group 15

This project is a part of an anti-ballistic missile system. The purpose is to determine whether an interceptor will launch or not to intercept an incoming anti-ballistic missile.

The code works by determining whether an interceptor will launch or not based on
planar data points and Launch Interceptor Conditions (LIC's).

## How to Build and Test

The code is written in Java and uses maven for building, for testing we use JUnit5.

To build the code, run `mvn clean install` in the root directory of the project. This will compile the code, run the tests, and package the code into a jar file inside of the `target` directory.

To just run the tests, run `mvn test` in the root directory of the project.
